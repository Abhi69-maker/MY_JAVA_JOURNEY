# MY_JAVA_JOURNEY
This repository contains all my Java practice programs and small experiments Iâ€™ve written while learning Java.
It includes topics like basics, loops, arrays, strings, and object-oriented programming.
I created this repo to track my progress and improve my coding skills step by step.
Each program focuses on one concept and helps me understand Java better.
More programs and small projects will be added as I continue learning. ðŸš€
